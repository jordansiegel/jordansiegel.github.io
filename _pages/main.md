I’m a former clinician turned researcher investigating how **negative social experiences, especially rejection, shape decision-making and emotional responses**. These processes are central to psychiatric conditions characterized by social dysfunction, including social anxiety disorder, borderline personality disorder, and depression.  

I'm currently a PhD cadidate at Adelphi University, working with [Dominic Fareri](https://home.adelphi.edu/~farerilab/). My dissertation work has been funded by the American Psychological Foundation Council Council of Graduate Departments of Psychology [COGDOP Dissertation Scholarships](https://ampsychfdn.org/funding/cogdop/). I received my MSW in clinical social work from the University of Pennsylvania in 2015 and my B.A. in psychology at Franklin & Marshall College in 2013.

Core questions that drive my work are:

- How does social rejection influence decision-making and emotional responses?
- What are the mechanisms—behavioral, computational, neural, physiological—through which negative social  
  experiences shape social behavior?
- Why do disruptions in these processes contribute to psychiatric conditions such as social anxiety disorder, 
  borderline personality disorder, and depression?
- How can insights from clinical training and computational psychiatry be integrated to inform interventions and 
  improve well-being? 

Outside of research, I’m a devoted college basketball fan, love outdoor adventures, and enjoy the arts.
